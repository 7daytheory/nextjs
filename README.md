Next.js full stack application

## Next JS
<p>Next JS simplifies the development process, and optimizes the web applications.</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Rendering</li>
<li>Routing</li>
<li>Api Routes (Fullstack Applications)</li>
<li>Automatic code splitting</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rendering:</h4>
<p>Next JS allows you to render on client side or server side rendering based on your needs. 
Client side is the code displayed when a user makes a request to the website.<br>
The server side rendering will take that request and process the request and display all of the info at once - not great for SEO.<br>
NextJS sends pre-rendered code directly to the browser which improves SEO.</p>

<h4>Routing</h4>
<p>In normal React, we install react-router-dom to handle the routing.<br>
In NextJS uses a file based <strong>routing system</strong> and the routing is handled by the file system - So if you have a folder named /about you can access it by going to /about automatically without external packages.</p>

<h4>Api Routes</h4>
<p>Enables the creation of serverless functions to handle API requests. <strong>Serverless APIs</strong> in Next.js are a way of creating API endpoints without the need for a traditional server. You can create an endpoint just by creating a file called route.js</p>

<h4>Automatic Code Splitting</h4>
<p>Code splitting is a technique that breaks down large bundles of javascript code into smaller, more manageable chunks that can be loaded as needed. It reduces the load time of web site and only loads the content when needed</p>
<p>In react, you use lazy loading and show something if it hasn't been loaded - in Next.js it does this automatically!</p>

### Next.js is still just React
<p>It simplifies certain tasks but it is still just react, while automating lots of functions that saves the developer time, it's just an extension of react</p>
